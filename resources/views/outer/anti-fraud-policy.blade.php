                        Fraud is a growing issue in the payments sector. The 2017 UK fraud indicator estimates that
                        fraud losses in the UK to be around Â£190 billion a year. Fraud is the most commonly
                        experienced crime in the UK.

                        These crimes can have devastating effects on victims. Victims may lose all their savings and
                        can be impacted psychologically. Criminals may use the funds stolen to fund illicit
                        activities that damage society such as people smuggling, terrorism, and drug trafficking.

                        Criminals use a wide range of methods to commit fraud with the theft of personal and

                        fraud losses in 2018. Fraud against individuals is typically targeted against elderly and
                        vulnerable people. Fraud is increasingly being committed online whereas previously this was
                        mainly committed through phone, post, or in person.

                        and abuse of position.

                        Victims are targeted through online dating apps or social networking sites. Romance scammers
                        create fake profiles on dating sites or contact targets through popular social media sites
                        like Facebook, Instagram, etc. The scammers will socially engineer the victims, striking a
                        relationship with their targets to build their trust, this can sometimes go on for months.
                        The scammer will eventually make up a story and ask for money.

                        requested to send a money transfer. The victim at this point may have become so emotionally
                        involved that it may become difficult to deter them from sending money. Ask the victim to
                        talk to a friend or relative about the situation and refuse the transaction.

                        The most important indicator that a consumer may be a victim of a scam is that they would
                        not have met the receiverx. Usually, social engineering can last for months/ years and the
                        criminal will not ask for money initially. The aim is to build trust and have the victim
                        emotionally involved at which stage the criminal will ask for money. It is important to
                        familiarize yourself with the various scam types which are discussed later in this document
                        so that victims can be identified and helped quickly.

                        that it is short. The fraudster will request to visit an ATM to withdraw the money but will
                        not
                        return. The recipient will be looking to collect the funds quickly to avoid the transaction
                        being
                        cancelled. Even if the payment number has not been provided, if the pc screen is visible,
                        the
                        fraudster may have noted this down.

                    </p>
                    <p class="">The following measures can be taken to prevent Agent / Partner victim
                        fraud:</p>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li>Installing a firewall and an anti-virus program. Ensuring that they anti-virus software
                            is regularly updated.
                        </li>
                        <li>For suspicious emails, hovering the mouse over the email address will provide details
                            on the intended recipient e.g. an email from {{ config('app.company_name')}} may show as {{ config('app.company_name')}} when
                            viewing the email but when the mouse has hovered over the address, what is shown is
                            completely different. Delete this email.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hovering the mouse over suspicious links, again this will show where the link is
                            directed.
                        </li>
                        <li>{{ config('app.company_name')}} will never request the username or password of an Agent / Partner or
                            request remote access unless a complaint has already been logged. If such a request is
                            received, no information should be provided which will allow the fraudster to have
                            access to the system.
                        </li>
                        <li>Agent / Partner should be extremely wary of emails that have generic greetings,
                            unsolicited correspondence, requests for personal information, have bad grammar or
                            spellings.
                        </li>
                        <li>Agent / Partner should Never process a transaction until the funds have been checked.
                        </li>
                        <li>Agent / Partner should Never accept a request to access the pc or give out the
                            username of password.
                        </li>
                        <li>Never accept a USB or CD with consumer details or for installing software.</li>
                        <li>If the caller provides a number to call, Never call this number.</li>
                        <li>Agent / Partner should Never leave the PC without first locking it.
                        </li>
                        <li>If an operator leaves, the log in codes should de-registered asap.
                        </li>
                        <li>Operator IDâs and password must never be shared.</li>
                        <li>Keep the computer screen hidden from consumers, Agent / Partner should Never have
                            this consumer facing.
                        </li>
                        <li>Unauthorized individuals should not be allowed behind the counter.</li>
