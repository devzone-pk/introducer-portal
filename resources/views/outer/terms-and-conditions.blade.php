                    <h2 class="">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
                    <p class="text-3 ">
                        Money transfers do not tend to give rise to conflicts of interest. If a conflict does occur,
                        {{ config('app.company_name') }} will provide the consumer with the details of the conflict
                        including the nature
                        of the conflict, and will ensure that the conflict does not result in a loss to the
                        consumer.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="">Jurisdiction of Law</h2>
                    <p class="text-3 ">
                        All matters arising from, or out of, or in connection with the agreement without any
                        limitation whatsoever shall be determined following English law and the parties hereby
                        submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to settle any
                        matter or dispute arising out of or in connection with it. A third party shall not have any
                        rights under the contracts (rights of the third-party act 1999) to enforce the contract.
